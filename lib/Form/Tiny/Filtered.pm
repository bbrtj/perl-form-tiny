=head1 NAME

Form::Tiny::Filtered - data filter before validation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# in your form class
	with qw(Form::Tiny Form::Tiny::Filtered);

	# optional - only trims string by default
	sub build_filters
	{
		return (
			[Int, sub { abs shift() }],
		);
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is a role which is meant to be mixed in together with L<Form::Tiny> role. Having the filtered role enriches Form::Tiny by adding a filtering mechanism which can change the field value before it gets validated.

The filtering system is designed to perform a type check on field values and only apply a filtering subroutine when the type matches.

By default, adding this role to a class will cause all string to be filtered with C<< Form::Tiny::Filtered->trim >>. Specifying the I<build_filters> method explicitly will override that behavior.

=head1 ADDED INTERFACE

=head2 ATTRIBUTES

=head3 filters

Stores an array reference of L<Form::Tiny::Filter> objects, which are used during filtering.

B<writer:> I<set_filters>

=head2 METHODS

=head3 trim

Built in trim functionality, to avoid dependencies. Returns its only argument trimmed.

=head3 build_filters

Just like build_fields, this method should return an array of elements.

Each of these elements should be an instance of Form::Tiny::Filter or an array reference, in which the first element is the type and the second element is the filtering code reference.

=head1 NAME

Form::Tiny::Meta - main class of the Form::Tiny metamodel

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	my $meta_object = FormClass->form_meta;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This documentation lists attributes and methods of the metamodel class of a
Form::Tiny form. For an overview, see L<Form::Tiny::Manual::Internals>.

=head1 ADDED INTERFACE

This section describes the interface added to your class after mixing in the
Form::Tiny role.

=head2 ATTRIBUTES

Each of the attributes can be accessed by calling its name as a function on
Form::Tiny::Meta object.

=head3 package

Contains the name of a package this metaobject belongs to. May be empty if the
form is anonymous.

Setting the package will automatically install a C<form_meta> method for it,
if it doesn't exist already.

B<predicate:> I<has_package>

B<writer:> I<set_package>

=head3 fields

Array reference of fields defined for this form. Each field can be either of
class L<Form::Tiny::FieldDefinition> (if it is static) or
Form::Tiny::FieldDefinitionBuilder (if dynamic).

Don't use this attribute if you want to obtain finished fields for a particular
form object - use L</resolved_fields> for that instead.

B<writer:> I<set_fields>

=head3 hooks

Array reference of hooks defined for this form. Each will be an instance of
L<Form::Tiny::Hook>.

B<writer:> I<set_hooks>

=head3 complete

Boolean flag used to keep track whether the form building has finished. The
form is considered finished after L<setup> method was fired.

A finished form is done with inheritance and ready to be customized. This
should usually not be a concern since form bootstrapping is done as soon as
possible.

=head3 meta_roles

A list of roles which have been applied to this metaobject. Children forms will
use it to apply the same roles to themselves. It is also used to apply
C<meta_roles> from L<Form::Tiny::Plugin>.

B<writer:> I<set_meta_roles>

=head3 form_roles

A list of roles which have been applied to the L</package>. Since the form
packages inherit from one another, this is not inherited from the parent's
metaobject. It is used to apply C<roles> from L<Form::Tiny::Plugin>.

B<writer:> I<set_form_roles>

=head3 messages

A list of messages used for creating errors in L</build_error>. The values are
usually set with L<Form::Tiny/form_message>.

=head3 is_flat

Boolean flag used to keep track whether the form is flat. Form is considered
flat if it has no nested or dynamic fields.

B<writer:> I<set_flat>

=head3 is_dynamic

Boolean flag used to keep track whether the form is dynamic. Form is considered
dynamic if it has dynamic fields. Note that a form cannot be flat and dynamic
at the same time.

B<writer:> I<set_dynamic>

=head2 METHODS

This section describes standalone methods available in the module - they are
not directly connected to any of the attributes.

=head3 new

This is a Moose-flavored constructor for the class. It accepts a hash or hash
reference of parameters, which are the attributes specified above.

=head3 build_error

	my $error = $meta->build_error($class => %params);

Builds an error of class C<"Form::Tiny::Class::$class"> and uses C<%params> to
contsruct it. If a custom message was defined for this type, it will be used.

=head3 run_hooks_for

	$meta->run_hooks_for($stage => @data);

Runs hooks for a given C<$stage>. C<@data> should contain all a hook type need for running.

=head3 bootstrap

	$meta->bootstrap;

Main metaobject initialization routine. It only runs if the model is not yet
complete. Performs inheritance and runs L</setup> after it's done.

=head3 setup

	$meta->setup;

Sets the form as complete and does nothing otherwise. It is meant to be used as
a checkpoint for any extensions where they can safely hook in and install their
custom behavior, for example:

	after 'setup' => sub {
		my ($self) = @_;

		$self->add_hook(...);
	};

=head3 resolved_fields

	my $result_aref = $meta->resolved_fields($form_object);

Returns field objects resolved for given C<$form_object>. The resulting array
reference will only contain instances of L<Form::Tiny::FieldDefinition> built
for given form.

=head3 add_field

Adds a new field to the form.

=head3 add_field_validator

Adds a new field validator to the form's field.

=head3 add_hook

Adds a new hook to the form.

=head3 add_message

Adds a new error message to the form.

=head3 inherit_roles_from

	$meta->inherit_roles_from($parent);

Inherits and applies various roles. If an extension would alter the way roles
are treated, this is the place to hook into.

=head3 inherit_from

	$meta->inherit_from($parent);

Inherits all the form attributes from C<$parent>. If an extension introduces
new fields and you want them to be inherited, you must hook to this method,
like:

	after 'inherit_from' => sub {
		my ($self, $parent) = @_;

		$self->set_my_field([@{$self->my_field}, @{$parent->my_field}]);
	};

=head3 static_blueprint

=head3 blueprint

	# for dynamic forms or when
	# it is not known whether the form in dynamic
	$blueprint = $meta->blueprint($form_object, %options);

	# for static forms
	$blueprint = $meta->blueprint(%options);

For blueprint explanation, see L<Form::Tiny::Manual::Internals/Form blueprint>.

For static forms without extra options, the blueprint will be cached and reused
on the next call. Otherwise, it has to be generated each time, which will
impose a performance hit if it is called frequently.

Additionally, the C<blueprint> method can accept a hash of options. Currently
supported options are:

=over

=item * recurse => Bool

If passed C<0>, subforms will not be turned into their own blueprints, but will
end up as a L<Form::Tiny::FieldDefinition> object instead. C<1> by default.

=item * transform => sub ($field_definition, $default_handler)

This option enables a way to specify a custom handler which will be used to
turn C<$field_definition> into a blueprint value. This subroutine reference is
expected to return a scalar value - a new blueprint value.

In case you want to turn back into the default handler, call C<<
$default_handler->($field_definition) >>.

=back

=head3 inline_hooks

Internal, implementation specific - returns flattened hook runners for runtime optimization.
